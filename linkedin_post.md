Excited to share a project I developed: a real-time Apache Security Monitoring Dashboard in Splunk!

In any Security Operations Center (SOC), the ability to quickly pivot from high-level alerts to granular log data is critical for effective incident response. I challenged myself to build a solution that transforms noisy, JSON-formatted Apache logs into a clean, actionable "single pane of glass."

This dashboard provides at-a-glance KPIs for server health and, more importantly, visualizes key threat indicators like:
- Top requested URIs (to spot scanning for vulnerabilities)
- Top source IPs (to identify potential DoS or brute-force attacks)
- A GeoIP map to instantly visualize the origin of all traffic

The goal was to move beyond reactive log searching and create a tool for proactive threat hunting. By turning raw data into clear intelligence, we can empower security analysts to detect and respond to threats faster.
