Here are three resume bullets that a Splunk hiring manager would find compelling for a top-tier SOC analyst role, based on the provided repository:

*   **Developed and deployed a real-time Apache monitoring dashboard in Splunk, providing a unified view of operational health and security threats for a high-volume web server, enabling proactive threat hunting and rapid incident response.**
*   **Authored advanced SPL queries to parse, transform, and visualize JSON-formatted logs, creating actionable intelligence that directly identifies security incidents such as forced browsing (4xx errors), directory scanning (top URIs), and potential denial-of-service (DoS) attacks (top IPs).**
*   **Implemented GeoIP-based threat intelligence using Splunk's `iplocation` and `geom` commands, creating a dynamic choropleth map to provide immediate situational awareness of anomalous traffic patterns and potential foreign-based attacks.**
